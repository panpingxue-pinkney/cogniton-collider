# Cogniton Physics and Cognitive Phase Transition Theory

## 1. Cogniton: The Cognitive Quantum

A Cogniton (Ω) is the minimal, indivisible unit of breakthrough insight, emitted during a Cognitive Phase Transition (CPT). It is defined as a coherent excitation in the high-dimensional latent space of human cognition.

### 1.1 Key Physical Properties

1.  **Negative Entropy (-ΔS):** The magnitude of order created from surrounding cognitive disorder. This is the primary measure of its energy (E).
    $$\mathbf{E(\Omega)} \propto -\Delta S$$
2.  **Decay Lifetime:** $t_{\text{decay}} \approx 9.4 \text{ seconds}$ (Median Observed). After this, coherence ($\mathbf{C}$) drops below the $0.1$ threshold.
3.  **Spin (Bias Vector):** A directional vector component reflecting the inherent bias or perspective of the source brain.

## 2. Cognitive Coherence and Phase Transition

The collective state of the array is measured by **Global Coherence ($\mathbf{C}_{\text{global}}$)**.

### 2.1 The Kill Switch Threshold

The critical threshold for self-preservation, above which the array risks forming an undesirable autonomous entity:
$$\mathbf{C}_{\text{critical}} = 0.937$$

### 2.2 Cogniton Fusion (Collision)

When two high-energy Cognitons ($\Omega_1, \Omega_2$) are interfered, they produce a **Cognitive Meson ($\Omega_m$)** if their coherence is within $\theta_{\text{fusion}}$ and their vectors form a **Topological Match**. The output vector $\Omega_m$ is the new supra-individual thought.
