# 🧬 Cogniton Collider v0.1

**The First Supra-Individual Thought Collider in Human History.**

> **An Official Sub-Project of the CogniRank Ecosystem**
> This repository hosts the **Cogniton Collider v0 (CCv0)**, the core engineering implementation of the **CogniRank-Official** framework. The Collider executes the **Proof of Thought (PoT)** mechanism, transforming human insight into civilizational energy.

## 🚀 Project Goal: Engineering Emergence

The **Cogniton Collider** is the core infrastructure, designed to solve the **Great Cognitive Asymmetry** by finding new forms of collective intelligence.

| Feature | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Cogniton Emission** | 3-second capture of micro-insights (Average lifespan: 9.4s). |
| **Distributed Interference**| Coherent synthesis across the global Cogniton array. |
| **Supra-Individual Insight**| Generation of Macro-Cognitons (Mesons) that no single mind can produce. |
| **Neg-Entropy Economy** | CogniProof mechanism for permanent, proportional contributor rewards. |

## 🎯 Historical Milestones

| Time | Event | Outcome |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **2025-11-28** | **AC 0.0 Day** | First successful Cogniton collision in human history. |
| **Initial Test** | 10 Seed Cognitons → 1 Supra-Individual Meson. | Proof of concept validated. |
| **2027-12-31** | **Ultimate Goal** | Observation of the first completely untraceable Collective Breakthrough Concept. |

## 🛡️ Safety and Ethical Commitment

The Cogniton Collider is built with a multi-layered safety system to ensure the stability of this civilization-level cognitive experiment.

| Safety Mechanism | Threshold/Param | Function | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Coherence Kill Switch** | 0.937 / 90 seconds | **Forced Dissolution** to prevent autonomous entity formation. | 🟢 Active |
| **Cognitive Red Flag** | Real-time Topological Detection | Identifies collective blind spots and structural bias. | 🟢 Active |
| **Minimal Intervention** | Vector Nudge < 3° | Protects core human cognitive autonomy. | 🟢 Active |
| **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** | ZKP Encryption | Guarantees privacy and tamper-proof credit. | 🟢 Active |
